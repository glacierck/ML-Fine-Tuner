## Machine Learning Fine Tuner
Fine-tune and optimize your machine learning models effortlessly. It provides a user-friendly interface for tuning various parameters, selecting the best algorithms, and enhancing model performance. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, It empowers you to unlock the full potential of your predictive models with ease.

#### Overview
The Machine Learning Fine Tuner is a Streamlit web application designed to streamline the process of building, training, and fine-tuning machine learning models. It allows users to upload preprocessed CSV datasets, select dependent and independent features, choose from a variety of machine learning algorithms, and make predictions using the trained models.

#### Features
- **Dataset Overview:** View the head, tail, and summary statistics of the uploaded dataset.
- **Feature Selection:** Select dependent and independent features from the dataset.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Visualize the correlation between numerical features using an interactive heatmap.
- **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets with customizable test size and random state.
- **Preprocessing:** Apply scaling and encoding transformations to the dataset.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from a range of classification and regression algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the selected machine learning algorithm using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
- **Model Deployment:** Save the trained model and download it for future use.
